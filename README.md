- ### Machine Learning

	- [Machine Learning: A-Z](https://github.com/EfthimiosVlahos/Data-Science-Portfolio-Micro-Projects/tree/master/EfthimiosVlahos-Machine-Learning-A-Z-Projects-master): ML Course form Udemy. Course contained personel projects from all fields of Machine Learning.
	- [SBU CSE 512 Final Project](https://github.com/EfthimiosVlahos/Data-Science-Portfolio-Micro-Projects/tree/master/SBU-CSE-512-ML-Final-Project-Comparing-and-Contrasting-ML-Tools--master): SBU final where we aimed to find out which tools out of SVM (Support Vector Machines), Random Forests, and ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) work best for classification on different data modalities with respect to gender classification.
	- [Yelp](https://github.com/EfthimiosVlahos/Data-Science-Portfolio-Micro-Projects/tree/master/NLP_Data_Science_ML_Project-master): Classified classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews.
	- [Higgs Boson Detection](https://github.com/EfthimiosVlahos/Data-Science-Portfolio-Micro-Projects/tree/master/Higgs_Boson_Particle_Detection_Project-master): In this repository, I have worked on higgs boson event detection project to classify given into signal or noise. this dataset was opensourced by CERN in 2014 and was built from official ATLAS full-detector simulation.
	- [Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs](https://github.com/EfthimiosVlahos/Data-Science-Portfolio-Micro-Projects/tree/master/Keras_Data_Science_ML_Project-master): Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), built a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Numpy
